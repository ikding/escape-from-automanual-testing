""" (this file is problem set three of three)


This file contains most of the code for four problems:

- Solving the "water jug problem" from *Die Harder* with stateful testing
- Solving the "Towers of Hanoi" puzzle with stateful testing
- Validating summary statistics for numeric types with metamorphic testing

If you're more interested in metamorphic testing, I'd skip down to the statistics
problem and then come back to the water jug problem if you finish early.

# The Water Jug problem.  Thanks to Nicholas Chammas for the idea and demo!
# Spoilers at http://nchammas.com/writing/how-not-to-die-hard-with-hypothesis

# In the movie Die Hard with a Vengeance (aka Die Hard 3), there is a famous
# scene where John McClane (Bruce Willis) and Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson)
# have to solve a problem or be blown up: Given a 3 gallon jug and a 5 gallon jug,
# how do you measure out exactly 4 gallons of water?
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cAbgAaEOVE

# We don't have a bomb handy, but we *can* make Hypothesis solve this for us!
# We just need to set up the state and possible actions... then we can claim
# that making random moves never leads to the "solved" state, and let
# Hypothesis find a counter-example.  Fortunately, Hypothesis will also
# shrink what it finds to a minimal sequence of actions!

# This pattern, where all the state lives on the RuleBasedStateMachine,
# is the easiest way to get started with stateful testing.

# 1. The state is not managed by the RuleBasedStateMachine, but by a
#    "system under test" (HanoiPuzzle), and
# 2. You will need to decide what actions possible, and use preconditions
#    to tell Hypothesis which are *valid* from the current state.

# Metamorphic testing and statistics demo: how hard can mean() be anyway?

# If you've done much numerical programming, the simple "laws of mathematics"
# taught in high school might seem like a fond and faded dream.
# Integer rounding, overflow and underflow, NaN, and floating point generally
# laugh at the simple behaviour of rational numbers.  Fortunately for our
# sanity, `fractions.Fraction` is one standard-library import away.
#
# Let's see how this can help via some metamorphic mean() testing....
#
# `test_mean_properties` is a template that you can use to explore
# metamorphic testing; for example checking that taking the mean, appending
# it to the input, and taking the mean again is equal to the first output.
# More suggestions below - and good luck with the floats() cases!
